## My process

### Workflow
 - Set up the project folder structure
 - Set up the project with Git
 - Set up Tailwindcss
 - Create HTML Skeleton based on mobile design `assets/design/mobile-design.jpg`
 - Work on mobile desing
 - Work on desktop desing
 - Write README.me
 - publish on github.io | github.com | frontendmentor.io

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwindcss
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to use `mix-blend-mode` for an image and `grid-template-columns: 1fr auto;` for creating a layout; auto value makes the parent tag a function of its children and grows as its children size.

### Continued development

Flexbox, Grid, and Tailwindcss are my practice area in further challenges.

### Useful resources
